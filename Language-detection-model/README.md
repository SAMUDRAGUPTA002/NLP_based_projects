# **Language Detection using Naïve Bayes**  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Language Detection Model** using the **Naïve Bayes algorithm**. The model is trained on a dataset of text samples in multiple languages and predicts the language of a given text input.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of text samples from multiple languages, with labeled examples for training. Each text entry is processed to extract relevant features for classification.  

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SAMUDRAGUPTA002/NLP_based_projects.git
   cd language-detection
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the model**  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps  
- **Text Cleaning** – Removing special characters, numbers, and extra spaces.  
- **Tokenization** – Splitting text into words.  
- **Stopword Removal** – Filtering out common words that don’t contribute much meaning.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Converting text into numerical form for model training.  

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation  
- **Algorithm Used**: Multinomial Naïve Bayes  
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision & Recall  
  - Confusion Matrix  

## 🔥 Results  
The model achieves **high accuracy (~95%)**, demonstrating effective language detection across multiple languages.  

## 💡 Future Enhancements  
- Expand dataset to support more languages.  
- Optimize feature selection for better performance.  
- Deploy as an **API or web app** using Flask/Streamlit.
