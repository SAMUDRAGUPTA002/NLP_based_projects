# 📌 Overview  
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** using **NLTK** and **Hugging Face Transformers**. The model analyzes text and classifies sentiments as **positive, negative, or neutral**.  

# 🚀 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- Hugging Face Transformers 🤗  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- PyTorch  

# 📂 Dataset  
This project can be applied to datasets like:  
- **Amazon Fine Food Reviews**  
- **IMDB Reviews**  
- **Twitter Sentiment Data**  
- **Custom Text Data**  

Each dataset consists of:  
✅ Text reviews or comments  
✅ Corresponding sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral)  

# ⚙️ Installation & Setup  
### Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAMUDRAGUPT002/NLP_based_projects.git  
cd sentiment-analysis  
```
### Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
### Download NLTK resources  
```python
import nltk  
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')  
```
### Run the analysis  
```bash
python main.py  
```

# 📊 Sentiment Analysis Methods  
### ✅ **NLTK VADER (Rule-based Approach)**  
- Works best on social media text, reviews, and informal text  
- Outputs compound sentiment scores  

### ✅ **Hugging Face Transformer (Deep Learning Approach)**  
- Uses pre-trained **RoBERTa** for advanced text classification  
- Outputs probability scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments  

# 🔥 Results  
- **NLTK VADER** is **fast and interpretable** for short texts.  
- **Hugging Face Transformer** provides **higher accuracy** for complex sentence structures.  

# 💡 Future Enhancements  
- Improve model performance with **fine-tuned transformers**  
- Train on **domain-specific datasets** for better accuracy  
- Deploy as an **API or web application** using Flask or FastAPI
